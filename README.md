# aseprite-kolor

Have fun with colours in Aseprite using the Aseprite Kolor Scripts!

In order to use them, download the `.lua` files found under the current release
and save them in Aseprite's folder for user scripts ([how]).

Alternatively, you can download the `.moon` files and compile them yourself!

## kolor-distrib

kolor-distrib gives you a visual representation of your favourite and most-used
colours in your current sprite.

Now you can turn your sprites from this:
